Build documentation from doc-strings for surrounding packages.

Place the sphinx-doc-helper in the same directories as a collection
of python packages like so:

    some folder
      - project a
           - python module x
           - python module y
      - project b
           - ...
      - sphinx-doc-helper
        - conf.py
        - Makefile
        - ...

Then running `make html` inside the `sphinx-doc-helper` directory
will create an html documentation inside `sphinx-doc-helper/_build/html`
including `project a` and `project b`.

You might want to check the [recognized syntax in Sphinx doc](https://ikerdocs-sphinx.readthedocs.io/syntax/index.html), which is reST, not Markdown.
We have napoleon activated to allow more readable [NumPy style docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) (which are automatically generated by Spyder).

Note: Since we are using sphinx-autoapi instead of sphinx-autodoc, the modules
are not imported or executed, just the source code is parsed. This allows
building the doc for scripts without side effects.

# Install and build
Install sphinx and extensions:

    conda install sphinx sphinx-autoapi sphinx-math-dollar

then run

    make html

# Math
The configuration makes MathJax available to render LaTeX in the documentation.

Caveat: You need to use regex-strings, preceded by an `r` to type the LaTeX
backlash correctly. In strings like `"\nu"` the backlash is interpreted as
escape character, resulting in a newline `\n`. Preceded by an r, the backslash
is treated literally: `r"\nu"`. The same holds true for doc-strings
`r"""bla"""`.

To use math, you can use the [single and double dollar signs](https://www.sympy.org/sphinx-math-dollar/)
to write math, as well as the [math directives](https://ikerdocs-sphinx.readthedocs.io/syntax/math.html)
